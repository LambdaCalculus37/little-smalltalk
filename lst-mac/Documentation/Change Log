Original file.st               restored (with instance variable 'fType' added to 'File' class header ). Image               Maker modified to read new file.           -  Method 'Class::fileOut' now supports file types.            -  Added 'Smalltalk::showMessage: aString' as a means of putting up a message               without having to use 'Smalltalk::error: aString'.           -  'Class::addSubClass:instanceVariableNames:' patched so that it doesn't remove               numbers embedded in instance variable names.           -  Pixel line length can now be specified for text-based panes.           -  Minimum window size reduced to 75x75.v3.1.3	-  Browser select panes no longer give an unknown message error if clicked on               when empty.           -  Pop-up menu objects removed from Smalltalk global array to avoid problems               of duplication of IDs when >15 pop-up menus have been created. Pop-up menu               IDs will only now be duplicated when the number created in any one session               exceeds 65435.           -  Message 'Smalltalk::getVersion' and primitive 254 added to return the version               string from the 'vers' resource as a Smalltalk string. Version number no               longer hard-coded in tclwin.st.           -  Dragging and dropping files ending in '.st' now invokes the compiler instead of               loading them into the active text window.           -  New system primitive (No. 20) added to allow implementation of 'become:'               message for objects. 'become:' added to basic object protocol.           -  'Array::grow:' changed to use 'become:' instead of returning new array. v3.1.4  (First widely distributed release)           - Added inspector.st and notifier.st to systemImage.           - Updated Enhanced User Interface Manual.           - ReadMe files updated and improved.           - Tidied up source code.v3.1.5  - Changed email address in readMe.mac file.           - Added noGoAwayWindow for non-closeable System Transcript window           - Multiple workspaces implemented.           - When 'Print it' is used, workspaces/System Transcript will highlight as selected the              result of the evaluated expression rather than continuing to highlight the expression              itself (this is easier to demonstrate than to explain. :-) ).           - Menu processing modified to perform messages instead of evaluating blocks. Block              evaluation for menu item processing is still supported.           - Command-key equivalents now supported in menus.           - Mouse button processing modified to perform messages instead of evaluating blocks.                Evaluation of blocks for mouse button processing is no longer supported due to               efficiency problems with double-click processing.           - 'Pull-down' menus can now function as pop-up menus. System menu now appears as a              pop-up menu in workspaces and the System Transcript window.           - 'Open a text file...' now shows a file requester _before_ opening a Workspace not              after.           - 'Save text' option replaced by 'Save' and 'Save as...', both of which operate according              to Apple guidelines.           - Appearance of spurious characters after loading a text file now fixed.           - 'Inspect It' added to System Menu.           - '-----------' delimiters removed from browser and Inspector.           - Class Pane now directly supports pop-up menus (to use: override              Pane>>createPopUpMenu, place the method selectors you wish to use as symbols in              your menu definition then set the menu's owner to the object defining these               selectors).           - Panes now have 'parent' as an instance variable to assist in inter-pane co-ordination              for objects that have more than one pane. (To use: set the pane's parent to the               co-ordinating object and use it to route inter-pane message sends).            - SelectListPane now supports an assignable source Collection and protocol to support:              ¥Êsending a message to the selected item              ¥Êsending a message to another object with the selected item as a parameter              ¥  evaluating a block with the selected item as a parameter.           - Browser, Inspectors and Notifier re-written to make use of changes to Pane and              SelectListPane.           - Partition size increased to 2Mb
