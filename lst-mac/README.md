# Little Smalltalk for Classic Mac OS
The source code for the Classic Mac OS implementation of Little Smalltalk 3.1.5.

**Compiling and Using**

Little Smalltalk for Mac OS runs on both 68K and PPC Macs running Mac System 7 up to Mac OS 9.2.2. In order to compile the source, you'll need Think-C v5 or later, or Symantec C++ and TCL 1.1.3.

I haven't tested this with Macintosh Programming Workshop, but feel free to try it out.

Little Smalltalk runs well in Basilisk II and SheepShaver, as well as real Mac hardware (of course!)

**License**

The Mac OS version of Little Smalltalk is public domain.

**Additional Resources**

I have uploaded the Little Smalltalk application itself to [Macintosh Garden](https://macintoshgarden.org/apps/little-smalltalk-315).

Think-C is also available on [Macintosh Garden](https://macintoshgarden.org/apps/think-c).

Have fun, and happy hacking! :)
