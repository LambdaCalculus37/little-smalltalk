	This Amiga port of Little Smalltalk is for Aztec C v3.20.
Compile with 16-bit integers (primitive.c requires cc flag -y200).
Name your final disk Smalltalk: and include st, :parser/parse,
and all files in :prelude.

	This package was intended for Unix, so it's surprising how few
changes were necessary:
1) Simulated enums with #defines.
2) Added rand().
3) Replaced redirection in parse's command line with a third argument.
4) system().  I've used AmigaDOS's Execute() even though it doesn't
provide a useful return code, since it does support calls to both CLI and C
programs, plus redirection.
