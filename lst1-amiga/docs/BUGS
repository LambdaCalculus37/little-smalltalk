KNOWN BUGS

1/1/85 assigning a block to a variable will usually cause memory reference
	cycles, resulting in the number of increments and decrements not
	being equal following execution.
	(not really a bug, caused by the implementation - blocks need to
	access the context, which includes the local variables, which
	includes the block, which needs to access the context ... )

1/1/85	The stack size allocated by the parser is fixed.  It should be
	computed by the parser and varied for different methods.

1/1/85  system should be modified to allow execution on system with no
	``system()'' system call (whew!).  This would involve using two
	programs - a parser to take class descriptions and turn them into
	internal form, and the smalltalk system.  Should be easy to do,
	however.

2/1/85	fast loading does not work on the HP9000

4/1/85	if you modify the class Smalltalk (and thereby the pseudo variable
	smalltalk) the pseudo variable does not get properly initialized.

4/1/85	Because of bootstrapping peculiarities, a few classes (such as
	Object or Symbol or String) do not respond to the message ``variables''
	correctly.
