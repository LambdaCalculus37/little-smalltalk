# Little Smalltalk for Amiga
The source code for the Amiga implementation of Little Smalltalk.

**Compiling and Using**

Little Smalltalk for Amiga runs on Amigas running up to Workbench 3.1 (it may run in AmigaOS 3.5 and 3.9 but I haven't tested so). In order to compile the source, you can use Aztec C v3.20 as per the original docs.

Little Smalltalk runs well in FS-UAE or your Amiga emulator of choice.

**License**

The Amiga of Little Smalltalk falls under the same license clause as v1 of Little Smalltalk.

**Additional Resources**

The original archive was originally released on [Aminet](https://aminet.net/package/dev/lang/SmallTalk). I'm mirroring the source to keep it alongside the rest.

Included in this source archive is an ADF of Little Smalltalk for use in FS-UAE, or to write to a floppy disk using tools like TS-GUI, or even to add to a USB stick and use with a Gotek.

Have fun, and happy hacking! :)
