         librarian of Current Notes.

          N O T E:  To fit all the files on a single disk, some had to
         be compressed.  The folder "BIN" has the arc'd file
         "LSTBIN.ARC" which contains "parse.ttp" and "ue.ttp (an early
         version of MicroEmacs).  The folder  "DOCS" contains the body
         of the manual (MANBODY) and three appendix files all combined
         in the arc'd file "LSTDOC.ARC". The main "ARC" program and
         its docs are included on this disk to allow you to expand
         these compressed files.  To expand the documentation, for
         example, move the LSTDOC.ARC file to a blank, newly formatted
         disk along with the ARC.TTP program.  Then double-click on
         ARC.TTP and, when asked for parameters, enter "x LSTDOC.ARC"
         which is the comand to  eXtract files from the archive
         LSTDOC.ARC.  Further options are explained in the ARC.DOC
         file.  You must expand the file PARSE.TTP in the BIN folder
         to get LITTLE SMALLTALK to work. All the example programs are
         in the arc'd file LSTEXA.ARC.

          NOTE: I have added the ARCSHELL programs to this disk to
         make it a little easier to unarc things.  However, to do so,
         I had  to move four files from the root directory and place
         them in smtalk.arc.  The files are ST.TTP (the main small
         talk program), SYNTAX, INSTALLG, and BUGS.  Sorry about all
         the compressing,  but that seemed better than making this a
         two-disk system.
          Below are some of the original "readme" docs:

                                 J.W.

                       * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
           The port to the Atari ST was done by Dave Clemans, based on
         the Amiga port distributed on "Fred Fish" disk #37.
          The "Little Smalltalk" executable is "st.ttp" in the root
         directory of this disk.  To run at all, you must have the
         following directories and files:
               \prelude\standard
               \tmp
               \bin\parse.ttp
               \lib
            "Little Smalltalk" needs write access to the disk that it
         runs on.

          Special notes:

          The port was done using the "Mark Williams" C compiler.
          The ")!" command executes commands directly and does not use
         a shell. Everything passed to ")!" must therefore be the full
         pathname of an executable file, along with any arguments that
         that program might need.

            The default editor is "\bin\me.ttp".

            Documentation for "Little Smalltalk" is in the folder











         \docs.

            Cursor positioning primivites are not supported (yet...).
         Plotting primitives are not supported.

            To re-build, set desired parameters in \src\env.h
         (particularly pathnames), and run make.  Once that finishes
         put st.ttp (Little Smalltalk executable) wherever you wish.
         Then go to \parse and run make, putting the result
         "parse.ttp" into the pathname that you specified for it in
         \src\env.h. Then go to \prelude and run make.  To re-iterate
         what was said above, this disk was built using the "Mark
         Williams" C compiler package and might not compile under
         other packages.  Also, there is not enough free space on the
         disk to rebuild a prelude or to compile anything; you'll have
         to move things around to re-compile.

          NOTE: The contents of this disk were constructed from the
         three CompuServe files listed below:

          LSTBIN.ARC

            Little Smalltalk from the University of Arizona.  To
         install: on disk with \lib, \tmp directories, put parse.ttp
         in \bin\parse.ttp, put standard into \prelude\standard, put
         your editor into \bin\me.ttp. Put st.ttp into \. Run "st.ttp"
         and your in Little Smalltalk. Exit via ^z. [NOTE: program has
         already been installed on this disk.]

          LSTDOC.ARC
          Arc file of documents for Little Smalltalk from the
         University of Arizona. This is an interpretive, non-graphics
         Smalltalk like language.

          LSTEXA.ARC

            This is an ARC file containing some short example programs
         for Little Smalltalk from the University of Arizona.
