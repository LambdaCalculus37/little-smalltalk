          sssstttt is an interpreter for a Smalltalk-like language.  For a
          complete description of the language accepted by the
          interpreter see the user manual.  Options accepted by the
          command are as follows:

          -a   If the -a option is given statistics on the number of
               memory allocations will be displayed following
               execution.

          -d_d_i_g_i_t
               If the _d_i_g_i_t is zero only those results explicitly
               requested by the user will be printed.  If 1, the
               values of expressions typed at the keyboard will be
               displayed (this is the default). If 2, the values of
               expressions and the values assigned in assignment
               statements will be displayed.

          -f   The -f option indicates fast loading should be used,
               which loads a binary save image (see ``)s'' below) for
               the standard library.

          -g   The next argument is taken to be the name of an
               additional library stored in the system library area.
               The library is loaded following the standard prelude,
               just as if a ``)g'' directive were given at the
               beginning of execution (see below).

          -l   The next argument is taken to be the name of a file
               containing a binary image saved using the )s directive
               (see below).  This binary image is loaded prior to
               execution.

          -m   Do not perform fast loading.  (Used when fastloading is
               the default).

          -n   The -n option, if given, suppresses the loading of the
               standard library. As this gives you a system with
               almost no functionality, it is seldom useful except
               during debugging.

          -r   The next argument is taken to be the name of a file of
               Smalltalk commands.  The file is included prior to
               execution, just as if a ``)r'' directive were given at
               the beginning of execution (see below).

          -s   In normal operation, at the end of execution the number
               of reference count increments and decrements is printed
               just prior to exit.  In the absence of cycles these two
               figures should be equal.  Since cycles can cause large
               chunks of memory to become unreachable, and seriously
               degrade performance, this information is often useful
               in debugging.  The -s option, if given, suppresses the
               printing of this information.

          The files, if given, must contain class descriptions.
          Consult the reference manual for the syntax for class
          descriptions.  The classes defined are included along with
          the standard library of classes before execution begins.

          Once execution begins, the cursor will tab over 8 spaces to
          indicate that a command can be entered.  A command consists
          of a valid Smalltalk expression, without a terminating
          period.  As each expression is entered it is executed by the
          Little Smalltalk interpreter, and the results displayed.

          The following system directives can be entered in place of
          commands:

          )e filename
               Edit the named file, which must contain only class
               descriptions.  The Little Smalltalk system will
               suspend, leaving the user in an editor for making
               changes to the named file.  Upon exiting the editor,
               the named file will automatically be included, as with
               the )i directive (below).  The editor chosen by this
               command is taken from the variable EDITOR in the user's
               environment.

          )g filename
               Search for a file with the given name in the system
               library area.  If found, load the library in with the
               users classes.  This is useful for creating libraries
               of commonly used classes which are not part of the
               standard prelude, such as classes for statistics
               applications or for graphics.

          )i filename
               Include the named file.  The File must contain one or
               more class descriptions.  The class descriptions are
               parsed, and if syntactically legal new instances of
               class CCCCllllaaaassssssss are added to the Smalltalk system.

          )l filename
               Load a saved binary environment.  The file must have
               been previously created using the )s directive (below).
               The values of all variables are overridden.

          )r filename
               Read the named file.  The effect is just as if the
               lines in the file had been typed at the keyboard.  The
               file cannot contain class descriptions.

          )s filename
               Save the current environment in the named file.  The
               values of all variables will be saved, and can later be
               restored using the )l directive (above).

          )!string
               Execute the string following the exclamation point as a
               Unix command.
