	The first major decision to be made in the memory manager is what
an entity of type object really is.  Two obvious choices are a pointer (to 
the actual object memory) or an index into an object table.  We decided to
use the latter, although either would work.
	Similarly, one can either define the token object using a typedef,
or using a define statement.  Either one will work (check this?)

	The memory module itself is defined by over a dozen routines.
All of these could be defined by procedures, and indeed this was originally
done.  However, for efficiency reasons, many of these procedures can be
replaced by macros generating in-line code.  For the latter approach
to work, the structure of the object table must be known.  For this reason,
it is given here.  Note, however, that ONLY the macros described in this
file make use of this structure: therefore modifications or even complete
replacement is possible as long as the interface remains consistent
